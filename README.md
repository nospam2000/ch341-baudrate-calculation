# ch341-baudrate-calculation HOWTO
How to calculate the baud rate of a CH341/CH340 usb serial adapter with a very small error rate

There is no publicly available document which explains the details about the registers and the
hardware of the CH341/CH340 usb serial adapter chips from WinChipHead (WCN).

This project is meant as a reference for drivers like the Linux and FreeBSD kernel or the Mac
OSX kernel because I really would like to use ESP8266 and ESP32 boards with a baud rate of 921600.

The contents of this project:
 - this README.md which describes how to calculate the baud rate and the limits.
 - [docs](./docs/) : a spreadsheet with calculations and measurements to prove that the used
   formulas are correct. It also contains the error calculation. Baud rates not contained can
   easily be added to see their error value.
 - [patches](./patches/) : a Linux kernel patch to use the new formula to calculate the baudrate
   and a unit test to compare the result to the original implementation and the implementation
   from Jonathan Olds' patch.
 - [measurements](./measurements/) : measurements of transmissions with some baud rates.
   The hex constants at the end of the name (e.g. 0x55_0x55) are the data which was transmitted

## How is the baud rate calculated?

It took me a while to figure it out, because all drivers are using magic constants like
1532620800 which are not clear. The FreeBSD driver was the best reference I could find.

The hardware has a great flexibility and can do most baud rates with a error smaller than 0.2%.
Most drivers give an acceptable baud rate for the medium baud rates like 38400, but almost all of
them fail at higher baud rates like 921600 and at unusual baud rates like 256000.

The base formular is very simply:

***baud rate = 12000000 / prescaler / divisor***

 - '12000000' is the 12 MHz oszillator frequency which is also needed for the USB bus clock
 - 'prescaler' scales down the 12 MHz clock by a fixed dividing factor between 1 and 1024 which
   can be choosen from the following 8 values: 1, 2, 8, 16, 64, 128, 512, 1024.
   Most drivers only use the following factors : 2, 16, 128 and 1024
   Internally this works by providing three clock dividers which are cascaded and can be
   separetely bypassed.
   The divider factors are: 2, 8 and 64
   By multiplying these factors in all possible combinations you get the 8 dividing factors
   mentioned above.
 - 'divisor' is a number which can be chosen from 2 to 256.

## How is the mapping between those variables and the registers of the CH341?

The ch341 has two registers which are related to the baud rate setting:
 - 0x12: Prescaler register 
 - 0x13: Divisor register

FreeBSD additionally sets a value to register 0x14 (UCHCOM_REG_BPS_MOD) but it is unclear
to me if this has any effect on the baud rate. My speculation is that this might have
something to do with the timing how long to wait for a character before sending the USB
burst transfer or the length of the stop bits? They calculate the value using the following formula:
  
  UCHCOM_REG_BPS_MOD = (12000000 / 4 / baudrate + 1650 + 255) / 256

### Prescaler register 0x12 (Linux: CH341_REG_BPS_PRE, FreeBSD: UCHCOM_REG_BPS_PRE)

Each bit of this register has a meaning on its own:
 - bit 0: =1 turns off the prescaler of factor 8
 - bit 1: =1 turns off the prescaler of factor 64
 - bit 2: =1 turns off the prescaler of factor 2
 - bit 7: =1 turns off waiting for buffer filled with 32 bytes before notifying the USB host.
   All drivers set this bit.

For example to get a prescaler of 16 use a value of `%10000010 == 0x82` to turn off the x64 divider
and activate the x2 and x8 dividers.

The meaning of the bits 3 to 6 is unknown, all drivers set them to 0.
They might contain some more modes about when to notify the host about newly received values.

### Divisor register 0x13 (Linux: CH341_REG_BPS_DIV, FreeBSD: UCHCOM_REG_BPS_DIV)

The divisor must be between 2 and 256. That means you have to choose a prescaler value so
that the divisor is within this range. The smaller the prescaler the larger and typical
better the divisor to get a small baud rate error.

The maximum officially supported baud rate is 2000000. A baud rate of 3000000 can also be
set and at least sending data at this rate is possible, but the stop bit length is too long
for baud rates > 500000, details see chapter below. The smallest possible baud rate is 46.

Here the formula for the register values based on the `prescaler` and `divisor` values:

    #define CH341_CRYSTAL_FREQ (12000000UL)
    divisor = (2 * CH341_CRYSTAL_FREQ / (prescaler * baud_rate) + 1) / 2
    CH341_REG_BPS_DIV = 256 - divisor

Using this formula together with choosing the right prescaler will give you an relative baud rate error <= 0.16% for the common baud rates. For all other baud rates between 46 to 100000 (the uncommon ones) the error is < 0.8% . Above 100000 baud you should only use selected baud rates.

#### Divisor values < 8 ####

The divisor register doesn't treat all values equally. The `divisor` values from 9 to 256 are
just used normally, but when `prescaler=1` the values between 8 and 2 give a divisor which is just half of its
value, for example using `divisor=8` only divides by 4.
                
`divisor = 1` results in a actual divisor of 78 when `prescaler=1` and is therefore not used.

#### Stop bit length too long for baud rates > 500000 ####
The minimum stop bit time for transmitting is 2.00 Âµs (see [scope picture](./measurements/3000000_baud_zoom_stopbit/F0007TEK.BMP?raw=true)) which is correct for 500000.
This means any baud rate above that has too long stop bits. For sending, this just
reduces the throughput (bytes/s) but I haven't tested if data is lost when a sender
with a correct stop bit time sends with full speed. 

##### Here the measured number of stop bits for sending data #####
###### <= 500000 baud: 1 stop bits ######
![scope picture](./measurements/500000_baud_0x55_0x55_0x55_0x55/F0010TEK.BMP)

###### 1000000 baud: 2 stop bits ######
![scope picture](./measurements/1000000_baud_0x55_0x55/F0009TEK.BMP)

###### 2000000 baud: 4 stop bits ######
![scope picture](./measurements/2000000_baud_0x55_0x55_0x55_0x55/F0008TEK.BMP)

###### 3000000 baud: 6 stop bits ######
![scope picture](./measurements/3000000_baud_0x55_0x55/F0006TEK.BMP)

#### Rounding issues ####

Why not just using the simple formula `(CH341_CRYSTAL_FREQ / (prescaler * baud_rate))`? Because we are using integer
arithmetic and truncating values after the division leads to an error which only goes into
the positive direction because the fractional part of divisor is lost.

With floating point arithmetic you would do 5/10 bankers rounding to spread the error equally
between positive and negative range:

    divisor = TRUNC(CH341_CRYSTAL_FREQ / (prescaler * baud_rate) + 0.5)

which is equal to

    divisor = TRUNC((10 * CH341_CRYSTAL_FREQ / (prescaler * baud_rate) + 5) / 10)

The first formula above does the same but using dual system integer arithmetic.


## How to choose the prescaler value and write the calculation code

You can use this code which iterates through all eight prescalar values in this order:
  1, 2, 8, 16, 64, 128, 512, 1024

When it finds a prescaler value which gives a divisor within the allowed range from 
4 to 256 it calculates `prescaler_register_value` and sets `foundDivisor=true`.
In [./patches] you can find a patch which can directly applied to a Linux kernel and is
updated more often than the code here.

        return r;

## How to set the registers?

Write to registers can only be performed two registers at a time. To write to a single register
either write two times the same value to the same register, or use a dummy register to write a
dummy value as second value. Fortunately we need to write exactly two register so we need one
call and one USB request.

    prescaler_register_value |= BIT(7); // don't wait until buffer contains 32 characters before sending
    divisor_register_value = 256 - divisor;
    ch341_control_out(dev, CH341_REQ_WRITE_REG,
      (CH341_REG_BPS_DIV      << 8) | CH341_REG_BPS_PRE,
      (divisor_register_value << 8) | prescaler_register_value);

## How to calculate the error
Because of rounding you always have an error when `12000000 / wanted baud rate` is not a natural number.
To calculate the real baud rate and the error, you have to use the calculated register values and do
the calculation with the formula ***resulting baud rate = 12000000 / prescaler / divisor*** 

The error formula: `error (in percent) = ((resulting baud rate / wanted baud rate) - 1) * 100`

For example the source from above gives the value `prescaler=1` and `divider=13` for the requested 
baud rate of 921600 (complete divisor=13):

    resulting baud rate = 12000000 / 1 / 13 = 923076.92 baud
    baud rate error = (923076.92 / 921600 - 1) * 100% = 0.16%

With `prescaler=2` and `divider=7` for 921600 baud (complete divisor=14 instead of 13):

    resulting baud rate = 12000000 / 2 / 7 = 857142.86 baud
    baud rate error = (857142.86 / 921600 - 1) * 100% = -6.99%

With `prescaler=2` and `divider=6` for 921600 baud (complete divisor=12 instead of 13):

    resulting baud rate = 12000000 / 2 / 6 = 1000000.00 baud
    baud rate error = (1000000.00 / 921600 - 1) * 100% = 8.51%

So you can see that choosing the correct prescaler value and using correct rounding is essential to get a smaller error.
